				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p><b>Collaborative workspace for like minded people from K.Bitragunta and surround villages to be in touch with each other and help local community.</b></p>
					<br />
					<p>As many of you know, I (@Ravi) like to spend my time in our village and try to help narrow the digital divide. I am grateful for the support I got from all of you for last 20 years. This is an effort to bring little more structure this work and allow others to help our community in their own ways.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Few months ago @Venkat Jammi, suggested we start a WhatsApp group to stay in touch and keep discussions going . I did like the idea, but I did not like WhatsApp groups based on my past experience. After giving some more thought, I realized slack may be better tool and  this is my attempt to experiment  with it and see if this can help us.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Pragna?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Pragna is a domain I (@Ravi) registered to start this slack channel. I have been thinking of setting up a organization to prepare kids from rural India to go to college. I believe getting to a college is one of the practical ways for disadvantaged kids to improve their lives. I am planning to register Pragna as a non-profit organization in the future. At this point this is just slack channel to help us do some work collaboratively.</p>
					<br />
					<p>You are welcome to join the and shape the current and future initiatives.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why slack? Why not WhatsApp?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Unlike WhatsApp, slack os designed for people in organizations to work together and be productive (Emphasis is productive work, not just chit chat). The core concept inside slack is channel. Each user can subscribe and leave channels as they like.This gives flexibility for users to participate in topics they are interested in and ignore the rest. </p>
					<br />
					<p>Slack is feature rich. You can direct message(DM) with each other, start channels (like groups), start conference calls with audio, video and, share your screen, integrate with pretty much every other application in the word and great with different documents and digital formats.</p
					<br />
					<p>Slack also encourages you to create quick channels and discard them. For example, a teacher in our school can create a channel for class project and discard in a month after the project.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Slack is the tool most organizations use for business now a days and learning this tool help our students and prospective job seeker a leg up during their job search and onboarding (Make a lot of our students digital savvy).</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What do I expect after joining this community?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>You will be automatically invited to #Welcome, #General channels along with your own scratch area with your name. Welcome channel will have this FAQ posted and covers discussions from new users, their issues while setting and learning slack. </p>
					<br />
					<p>You can join other channels like #schools, #temples, #random, #visits, #college. You can start collaborating on any of these channels or create your own and invite others.</p>
					<br />
					<p>#visiting channel is meant for travel and sharing their experience. Any one visiting the village from outside can post content related to travel dates, details about the visit and other ways to make the trip more interesting useful. See my posts to learn about the ideas I am planning to work during my January 2019 trip. Some of these topics will get their own channel when I make more progress.</p>
					<br />
					<p>Feel free to create new channels or suggest them so someone can create them for you.</p>
